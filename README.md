# iCook - Recipe App

## Introduction

Welcome to iCook, your culinary companion in the digital world! This project, developed as part of my ALX End of Foundations Portfolio, is a recipe app that invites users to explore, save, and enjoy a variety of delightful recipes. Crafted with Python Flask, JavaScript, Jinja2, and fueled by the Edamam API, iCook seamlessly blends backend logic, frontend interactivity, and database management to create a flavorful user experience.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Backend:
- Flask (Microframework for Python)

### DevOps:
- Digital Ocean server for hosting
- .tech domain for online presence
- Nginx web server for handling HTTP requests
- Gunicorn application server for serving Flask application
- Certbot for SSL encryption
- UFW firewall for security

### Database:
- SQLITE for local development
- MYSQL for the server

## Architecture

The architecture of iCook follows a well-thought-out structure to enhance code organization. Here's an overview of the key components:

- **Application Logic (app folder):**
  - `static` and `templates`: Flask uses the 'static' folder to serve static assets (CSS, JS, and images) and the 'templates' folder for HTML templates.
  - **Python Modules:**
    - `errors.py`: Manages error logic and custom error pages.
    - `forms.py`: Flask forms to handle user input.
    - `__init__.py`: Marks the 'app' directory as a Python package.
    - `models.py`: Defines database models.
    - `routes.py`: Defines Flask routes and views.
  - **Configuration and Main Application File:**
    - `config.py`: Holds configuration settings for the Flask application.
    - `icook.py`: Main application module for the Flask application. Sets up Flask and provides utility for Flask shell.
  - **Auxiliary Directories:**
    - `migrations`: Contains database migration scripts.

- **Testing:**
  - `tests.py`: Test cases for the Flask application.

- **Documentation:**
  - `README.md`: Comprehensive information about the project.

   - Set up SSH access and log in to your Droplet from your local terminal.
   - Create a less privileged user and give them sudo privileges.
   - Set up SSH for the user by adding your public key into `.ssh`.
   - Exit and SSH into the droplet as the less privileged user.
   - Secure your server with UFW.
